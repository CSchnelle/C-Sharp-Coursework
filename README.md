# C---Coursework
Coursework completed for classes in C#
This contains several assignments completed for class. Some include projects done using tutorials, others are original. Anything completed with a tutorial is from educator Jesse Liberty. Other assignments or code snippets that I have written are explicitly free to use in this repository.
